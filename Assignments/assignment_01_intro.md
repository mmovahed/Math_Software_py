# Assignment 01: Python Basics

## ðŸŒŸ Goals
- Understand Python syntax, variables, data types, and control flow.
- Practice defining functions and using loops.

## âœ… Tasks

1. **Variables and Data Types**  
   Define the following variables and print their types:
   - an integer
   - a float
   - a string
   - a boolean

2. **Basic Arithmetic**  
   Write a Python script that:
   - adds two numbers
   - calculates their product
   - prints the result of raising one to the power of the other

3. **Conditional Statements**  
   Ask the user to input a number. Print whether the number is:
   - positive, negative, or zero
   - even or odd

4. **Loops**  
   Write a loop that prints all numbers from 1 to 20 that are divisible by 3.

5. **Functions**  
   Write a function `factorial(n)` that computes the factorial of a number using a loop.

## ðŸŒŸ Optional Challenge
- Create a simple text-based calculator that takes two numbers and an operator from the user and performs the appropriate operation.

## ðŸ“Œ Instructions
- Save your answers in a notebook named `assignment_01.ipynb`.
- Test all your code and add short comments for clarity.
