# Assignment 02: NumPy Basics

## ðŸŒŸ Goals
- Understand array creation and manipulation with NumPy.
- Perform basic mathematical and matrix operations.

## âœ… Tasks

1. **Create Arrays**  
   Create the following arrays:
   - A 1D array of numbers from 10 to 20
   - A 3x3 matrix filled with random integers between 1 and 10

2. **Array Operations**  
   - Multiply the 1D array by 2
   - Compute the square of each element
   - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the array

3. **Matrix Operations**  
   - Create two 2x2 matrices A and B
   - Compute A + B, A - B, and A * B (element-wise)
   - Compute the dot product of A and B

4. **Indexing and Slicing**  
   - Extract the first row and first column of a 3x3 matrix
   - Change the center element to 0

## ðŸŒŸ Optional Challenge
- Write a function that normalizes a NumPy array to have values between 0 and 1.

## ðŸ“Œ Instructions
- Save your answers in a notebook named `assignment_02.ipynb`.
- Use comments to explain each step of your solution.
