# Assignment 06: Linear Algebra with NumPy

## ðŸŒŸ Goals
- Understand and apply basic matrix operations.
- Solve linear systems and compute eigenvalues.

## âœ… Tasks

1. **Matrix Operations**  
   - Create two 2x2 matrices A and B.
   - Compute A + B, A - B, A * B (element-wise), and A dot B.

2. **Transpose and Inverse**  
   - Find the transpose of matrix A.
   - Check if A is invertible (determinant \u2260 0) and compute its inverse.

3. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**  
   - Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

4. **Solving Linear Systems**  
   - Solve the system \( Ax = b \), where \( b = [5, 11] \).

## ðŸŒŸ Optional Challenge
- Write a function that checks whether a given matrix is symmetric and orthogonal.

## ðŸ“Œ Instructions
- Save your answers in a notebook named `assignment_06.ipynb`.
- Use clear print statements to display results and explanations.
